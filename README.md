# Oboe bug, server-side template

The goal of this repo is to provide a quick template for you to recreate bugs
you find with the [Oboe.js](https://github.com/jimhigson/oboe.js) library.

Fork this project and edit the files to demonstrate your bug, then provide a
link to it when you file an [issue](https://github.com/jimhigson/oboe.js/issues).

Thanks!
